This GitHub organization holds the outputs of the [CLLD project](https://clld.org), in particular

- the [clld framework](https://github.com/clld/clld), the Python package that all web apps serving CLLD databases are built on
- several [plugins](https://github.com/clld/clld#usage) extending the functionality of `clld`
- the sources of many `clld` web applications

Arguably the most important output the CLLD project contributed to is missing, though. For CLDF-related packages and documentation,
see the [CLDF organization](https://github.com/cldf).
